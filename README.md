## Building

On any *nix system it _should_ be as simple as:

```
git clone https://github.com/lunasorcery/pridecat.git
cd pridecat
make && make install
```

This depends on a recent (C++11) C++ compiler being available. If you encounter issues, please let me know.

## Windows support?

There's currently no Windows-compatible build setup, but the code should work under the notable windows terminals if you compile it with cl.exe. Tested in cmd, PowerShell, and Windows Terminal.

It also appears to work out-of-the-box in WSL.
